# Book-Recommendation-System
This is a book recommendation system that uses a user-based collaborative filtering method to recommend books to users. The system takes as input a user's past ratings of books, and then uses this information to recommend other books that the user is likely to enjoy.  The system is implemented in Python using the Surprise library.
