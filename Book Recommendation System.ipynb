    "This is a book recommendation system that uses a user-based collaborative filtering method to recommend books to users. The system takes as input a user's past ratings of books, and then uses this information to recommend other books that the user is likely to enjoy.  The system works by first creating a matrix of similarity scores between all users. This matrix is created by comparing the ratings that each user has given to the same books. The higher the similarity score between two users, the more likely it is that they will enjoy the same books.  Once the similarity matrix has been created, the system can then recommend books to a user by finding other users who have similar tastes and then recommending books that those users have rated highly.  The system is implemented in Python using the Surprise library. The Surprise library provides a number of different algorithms for creating and using collaborative filtering recommender systems."
